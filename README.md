# MegazordSynth
A wavetable synth based on NES waveforms and an arpeggiator suitable to run on a Raspberry Pi with Supercollider and PiSound.

The NES waveforms were sampled by Adventure Kid: https://www.adventurekid.se/akrt/waveforms/akwf-nes-8-bit-free/

This synth requires a Novation Launchkey Mini in order to run. 

Please download the Novation Launchkey Extension and place it in your Supercollider Extensions folder:
https://github.com/baruchtomer/NovationLaunchSeries

Then download the current repository and move the files inside "Extensions" into your Supercollider Extensions folder.
